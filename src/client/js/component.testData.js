  'CHESANING, MI—Noting that it was her right as an American citizen to decide when\n' +
  'and where she would urinate and defecate, 3-year-old Madison Ackrite told\n' +
  'reporters Wednesday that she was simply exercising her constitutionally\n' +
  'guaranteed freedom of choice when she refused to use the potty. “My decision to\n' +
  'pee-pee and poo-poo in the place of my choosing is a private health decision,”\n' +
  'said Ackrite, noting that there was still a lot she didn’t know about the potty,\n' +
  'and until she had done enough research to satisfy her concerns, she would\n' +
  'continue to relieve herself in her pull-up diapers, as was her right in\n' +
  'accordance with the rule of law. “Unlike a lot of the kids in my daycare, I am\n' +
  'not a sheep. If you want to use the potty, that is your personal choice, and no\n' +
  'one is stopping you. All I ask is that you respect my decision, which is based\n' +
  'on my personal belief that I hate going to the potty. I hate it, hate it, hate\n' +
  'it!” At press time, Ackrite refused to answer whether or not she had emptied her\n' +
  'bowels on the living room floor, arguing that her refusal to divulge such\n' +
  'information was protected by the courts.\n' +
